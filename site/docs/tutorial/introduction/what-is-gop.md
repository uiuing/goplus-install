# what is Go+ ?

## Introduction

The Go+ programming language is designed for engineering, STEM education, and data science.

- **For engineering**: working in the simplest language that can be mastered by children.
- **For STEM education**: studying an engineering language that can be used for work in the future.
- **For data science**: communicating with engineers in the same language.

## Key Features of Go+

- A static typed language.
- The simplest engineering language that can be mastered by children (script-like style).
- Performance: as fast as Go (Go+'s main backend compiles to human-readable Go).
- Fully compatible with [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) and can mix Go/Go+ code in the same package (see [Go/Go+ hybrid programming](https://github.com/goplus/gop/tree/main/doc/docs.md#gogo-hybrid-programming)).
- No DSL (Domain Specific Language) support, but it's Specific Domain Friendly (see [DSL vs. SDF](https://github.com/goplus/gop/tree/main/doc/dsl-vs-sdf.md)).
- Support Go code generation (main backend) and [bytecode backend](https://github.com/goplus/igop) (REPL: see [iGo+](https://repl.goplus.org/)).
- [Simplest way to interaction with C](https://github.com/goplus/gop/tree/main/doc/docs.md#calling-c-from-go) (cgo is supported but not recommended).
- [Powerful built-in data processing capabilities](https://github.com/goplus/gop/tree/main/doc/docs.md#data-processing).
